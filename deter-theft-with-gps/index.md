# Deter Theft with GPS

Modern mobile devices (phones, PDAs, laptops, etc) could deter theft by all but the most hardened criminal, and it would only require the simplest of modifications to the firmware in many of the devices already on sale.

We were recently looking at an application called "Private-I" for the iPhone: it's designed to look interesting to someone who's stolen (or found) the phone. When they open the application, it cunningly says it's "loading" things; but what it's _really_ doing is transmitting its GPS coordinates to a preconfigured email address.

As the inquisitive thief waits in vain for the thing to load, the GPS fix gets better and better, so additional emails are sent, pinpointing the phone so it can be retrieved.

It's cute but in most cases it's somewhat irrelevant because the amateur thief is not going to get through the access control system unless they get lucky (be it a PIN, a password, a biometric lock, or whatever). It makes sense therefore to dispense with the subterfuge of the cute application and just link the access control system of the device with a system for transmitting GPS coordinates.  i.e.

* Each time the correct pin is entered, the phone unlocks.
* Each time an incorrect pin is entered, the phone transmits its location.

This simple change won't stop a professional thief (they can still break the device up for parts, or reset it to factory defaults), but anyone who finds a phone that's been dropped or accidentally left somewhere will have a strong deterrent against trying to use it ... what's more all the police have to do is switch it on when it's kindly handed in and the owner will know where to collect it.
