# 15 New Referral Spam Domains

Over the last few days the referral spam tide has ebbed and flowed: for about a week, everything that came in was pointing to doobu.com, then today, there was a definite change in tactic as 15 new poker related domains were added to the ever growing list (see the existing story on referral spammers for the <a href="/referral-spammers">updated table of details</a>).

I'm starting to wonder if it's worth creating an RSS feed that would update as I discover each new referral spammer. This might then provide a viral trust network so that queries could be rejected based on the referrer - as soon as a spammer is positively identified, any requests featuring it would just get Forbidden.

I already have a db table in my StatTraq MySQL server, so knocking up an RSS generator should be a doddle.

Raise your hand with a comment anyone who'd like to encourage me to develop it, or I'll just keep commenting idly...
