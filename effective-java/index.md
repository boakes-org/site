# Effective Java

This book can impart the knowledge & understanding you need to write better code than you currently know is possible. Herein are techniques which once mastered can be reused in any language throughout your career as a Software Engineer.

This is an exceptionally well written book about programming techniques which just happens to be (a) about Java and (b) from someone who's close enough to the core Java team to really hit the nail on the head.

Make this your first serious Java book after you're comfortable with the basics. It's deeply technical, and an enjoyable read, a real rareity.
