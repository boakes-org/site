# Essex council turns off the lights

**Q:** How many Essex-girls does it take to change a lightbulb?
**A:** The same number as before, but the lightbulb lasts longer because its used less.

Kudos must go to the big brains in Essex County Council; their [recent decision](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/5179610.stm) to [switch off street lights between midnight and 5am](http://www.essexcc.gov.uk/vip8/ecc/ECCWebsite/dis/ned.jsp?oid=77786) makes clear economic and ecological sense.

They've stated that in some places the lights will have to remain on, but hopefully the continuing commoditization of infrared movement sensors can enable Essex and (more impotantly) other councils to adopt more aggressive energy saving measures in the not too distant future, allowing us to have dark (or at least much dimmer streets) in places where animals aren't moving.

So, that's lower council tax, _and_ the ability to see the starry night.  Essex house prices just inflated again.
