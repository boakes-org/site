# Analysing MyNiceMailAt.com

I'm hoping to spend some time over the next 'n' weeks understanding the [data generated from the mynicemailat domain](/my-nice-spam-domain), though I'm a bit busy with real experiments at the moment, so I intend to do it by thinking aloud here as I get the opportunity.

## First pass

I've quickly run off a couple of basic queries to get things going. All figures here are measured after search bots and referral and comment spammers have been removed from the data, and they're based on the live log data that StatTraq gives me.

Total times the mynicemailat site was hit: `1729`
Distinct IP addresses visiting mynicemailat.com : `1198`
Total number of readers who arrived there by clicking on a spam comment: `1123`
The gap between `1123` and `1198` is made up by people who arrived from search engines, and webmail providers.

So in terms of raw traffic, the amount generated was negligible, but, even with this small change, my Alexa traffic rank for this site briefly went into the 100,000's, for about a week. It's returned to the 500,000 mark now. What this shows is that my day-to-day visitors tend not to be users of the Alexa toolbar.
