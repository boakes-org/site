# Comment Spam

In accordance with the announcements made today by [Google](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html), [MSN](http://blogs.msdn.com/msnsearch/archive/2005/01/18/nofollow_tags.aspx), [Yahoo](http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000069.html) et al. my website now supports the "rel=nofollow" directive in all links made from comments (thanks to [Clint Ecker's WordPress Plugin](http://phaedo.cx/)).

Consequently, comment spammers everywhere will no longer be able to benefit from any pagerank that they might think they can steal from me. -1 Spammers. +1 Nice Humans. I already moderate every comment, so this is a "belt and braces" approach to ensuring my site stays nice.
