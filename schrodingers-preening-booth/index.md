# Schrödinger's Preening Booth

[Schrödinger's cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger's_cat), bless it's little white paws, had a pretty tough time of it; what with being locked in an imaginary box, and having to share that space with only a decaying radioactive isotope. At the end of the experiment, when the box is opened and the cat is observed, it's probability wave collapses into either a live cat or a dead cat. It's not exactly an easy life (or death). I was therefore especially pleased today to read of [Kirsher's Hall of Mirrors for cats](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/03/08/hall_of_mirrors_for.html). Schrödinger never saw fit to describe the interior decoration of the box, so it struck me that if the box were a hall of mirrors, such as Kirsher's, then the cat could observe itself; thus collapsing it's own probability wave and therefore, either

1.  instaneously ceasing to exist, the moment the isoptope decays, or
2.  continuing to exist, and spending an hour in a private preening booth (surely this is cat heaven?). Ok, so there's unlikely to be a Nobel prize for this one, but if I keep coming up with ideas then the probabilty has to increase, and if I sit in a room full of mirrors whilst I think...
