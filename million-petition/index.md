# One million road petitioners can't be wrong, can they?

The [experimental petition system](http://boakes.org/petiton-the-pm/) that Downing Street is running has generated it's first [1,000,000 signature petition](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6349027.stm): it asks the PM to "[scrap the planned vehicle tracking and road pricing policy](http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/traveltax/)" and it's a great example of how public opinion is not necessarily good for the public.

## What do the petitioners think they are supporting?

The petition subtext highlights that there is already an effective travel tax administered through the cost of fuel: "_The more you travel - the more tax you pay_" it explains helpfully. Next it goes for the heart strings, calling the proposed monitoring system "_an unfair tax on those who live apart from families_" and it pours pity on the "_poorer people who will not be able to afford the high monthly costs_". It rounds off with a stirring and simple plea: "_Please Mr Blair - forget about road pricing and concentrate on improving our roads to reduce congestion._" So that's:

1.  Standing up for poorer people,
2.  Reuniting estranged families,
3.  Caring for the commuter who's stuck in congestion. This is a petition (and therefore a million petitioners) with heart and compassion: it's very warm and fuzzy, but it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

## An Existing and Necessary Tax

The petition calls for road improvement but roads are not created or improved without investment. Funds don't magically appear at the [Dept. for Transport](http://www.dft.gov.uk/) without tax, so the petition is implicit in it's agreement that a travel tax _is_ necessary, it's just misguided about the most fair means of delivering it. As the petition points out there is already an effective tax on travel, through fuel, but it neglects to mention that:

1.  Poorer people are _already_ affected by a high travel tax.
2.  Families that live apart are _already_ taxed when they travel to see each other. So the warm and fuzzy words about "poorer people" and "families" obscure the real issue, that the petition is merely opposing is an _alternative mechanism for taxation_; not an additional tax.

## Our Electric Future and the Green Tipping Point

Electric vehicles create less [atmospheric pollution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution) and less [noise pollution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution) than their [combustion engined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine) counterparts. At present, there are large tax incentives for people who switch to electric or hybrid vehicles in the combined form of a [reduced road fund license fee](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/OwningAVehicle/HowToTaxYourVehicle/DG_10012524), and a reduced need to purchase heavily taxed fuel. There will hopefully come a time when a green tipping point is reached, where the number of alternatively powered vehicles is large enough that the fuel tax is no longer a viable mechanism for funding road maintenance. **This green tipping point cannot come soon enough**, in my opinion, and it's the reason why an alternative mechanism for travel tax is a necessity. Electric vehicles cannot travel without roads, so a travel tax will still be necessary, however, in urging the Prime Minister to abandon this line of investigation, the petitioners are supporting a taxation system that is becoming obsolete.

## Diminishing Returns and Fairer Taxes

In recognizing that revenue from the existing fuel tax will diminish, we must also accept that a government that did not investigate alternative sources of funding _should_ be accused of negligence and short-sighted governance. The government is only a representative of the people, so demanding the cessation of research into those alternatives _is_ short sighted by the people who signed the petition. An important aspect of a journey-based tax was overlooked in the simple text of the petition and it is this: once travel-tax is decoupled from fuel, it can be applied to the journey and the traveler directly, so if somebody who's "poorer" is traveling, they may be able to travel at a lower tax rate. Journeys to and from job interviews could be subject to tax incentives. Journeys during peak times could be charged at a higher rate, meaning those with good jobs who choose to commute in busy times every day would pay more. Family gatherings would end up costing less because they tend not to require peak period travel. In fact, all kinds of journeys could become subject to either incentives or penalties which overall would make travel taxation more fair. The people who signed the petition didn't see that - what they saw was an emotive plea that was not backed up by any real consideration for the facts.

## Improved Planning

Todays monitoring systems can tell us that _n-hundred-thousand_ vehicles pass a particular point on a particular motorway each day, which is quite useful for road planning. Knowing the entire journey of each of those vehicles will give a far greater insight into where and how specific roads should be improved (through the application of techniques such as [Ant Colony Optimisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization)).

## Conclusion: There is No Alternative to Journey-Based Tax

Road usage, and thus, congestion, will continue to increase. Without an improved mechanism of taxation on travel, the gradual switch to electric vehicles will result in reduced funds being available to the DfT for road maintenance. Poorer people will still be taxed as they are today, and families that live far apart will continue to be taxed at the same rate on journeys that take longer as peak time congestion increases because of an overburdened road infrastructure. Road congestion will not just affect private citizens, the goods vehicles get stuck in jams too, which increases the delivery cost of whatever they're carrying, which in turn is passed on to the consumer, a few pence added to an expensive item like a TV makes very little difference, but for companies that are hauling basics such as grain, fruit & veg, this puts a significant extra markup on everyday items that "poorer people" cannot afford not to buy. An alternative journey-based taxation system, could encourage more flexible travel practices by all and enable travel by "poorer people" through targeted tax incentives and journey-based insurance policies. The empirical knowledge of the road network and it's use would lead to more effective improvements that are targeted at the problems of congestion (rather than the symptoms, which are all that can be monitored by measuring traffic flow and choke points). So looking at the subtext of the petition again and see how it stacks up:

1.  _Standing up for poorer people_ - **failed** - with high fuel-based taxes they're no better off when traveling, and with increased freight costs, the basic cost of living will increase.
2.  _Reuniting estranged families_ - **failed** - with high fuel based charges and increasing congestion they're worse off: it will take longer and thus cost more in fuel to get home.
3.  _Caring for the commuter whoâ€™s stuck in congestion_ - **failed** - with increased congestion and high fuel charges they'll switch to an electric vehicle, but still be stuck in traffic, on a road system that is not properly maintained, so they're worse off too! One million people _can_ be wrong. One million people put their name to a solution which only exacerbates the problems that they are hoping to solve.
