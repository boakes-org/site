<h1 id="sentencing-saddam-hussein-to-death-seems-misguided">Sentencing Saddam Hussein to Death Seems Misguided</h1>
<p id="bbcnewshavebeenexten">BBC news have been extensively reporting that former Iraqi dictator <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6117910.stm">Saddam Hussein has been sentenced to death</a>, following his conviction for crimes against humanity. This sentence shows that a respect for human rights is not a part of the freedom that has been offered to the Iraq people by "the coalition of the willing". On 22nd March 2003, US President George W. Bush stated that the purpose of prosecuting the war in Iraq (aka "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030322.html">Operation Iraqi Freedom</a>") was: "to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people". The first two of those objectives can be classified as self defence, and have subsequently been the subject of much debate when no WMD's were discovered and and no significant support to "terrorism" was shown to exist. Arguing over these two points could continue all night, so having paid lip service to them, I shall instead focus on the third objective which is far more important for humanity. It is a noble and just objective to bestow freedom upon the people of a whole country. In closing that same speech, Mr. Bush reinforced his message saying that the war was "a fight for the security of our nation and the peace of the world, and we will accept no outcome but victory." So, if the objective is to "<em>free the Iraqi people</em>" then "<em>victory</em>" can only be claimed when all Iraqi's are offered complete and untainted freedom by being granted their <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">Human Rights</a>, without limitations. Human Rights are not a utopian goal to be aimed for. They are the starting point for any democratic society; the absolute bare minimum. Imposing the death penalty on any Iraqi citizen (including the former dictator) is a breach of Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>: </p>
<blockquote id="pstrongeveryonehasth">
<p><strong>Everyone has the right to life</strong>, liberty and security of person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="thisthereforeisaprob">This therefore, is a problem, because it can be argued that any state which takes life, is no better than any individual or head of state that takes life; so the new regime is no better than the old one, which has been accused of myriad similar human rights violations. If Saddam Hussain is executed, then victory in <em>Operation Iraqi Freedom</em> will be a long way off, because freedom for the Iraqi people will have been dealt a visible setback through the withholding of human rights for all Iraqi citizens.
