# As seen on TV

Several weeks ago [I met Justin Hendiks](/holiday-scams-on-dutch-tv), a reporter for Dutch TV programme Opgelicht. He's been researching the unsolicited phone calls that Dutch citizens have been receiving over the last few months. It seems that the Dutch must have borrowed some of luck of the Irish because every single person that received a marketing call was told they had won a holiday.

Since this site has a [story](/ameri-who) about similar calls, we got chatting, and I was able to show Justin all of the publically available information regarding the companies that are (or appear to be) involved, or in some way associated.

The story was broadcast on last night's programme, and [according to Media Log](http://medialog.blogspot.com/2005/10/kijkcijfers-van-dinsdag.html), it was watched by 1,094,000 people. So by my feeble calculations, one in 16 Netherlanders are now far more aware of the (mal)practice. Since it's now just after the lunchtime, I'm sure the knowledge has spread that such phonecalls are (at best) nothing more than a dishonest marketing ploy.
