# Four Levels of Competency

I was tickled to read in [Teaching by Lecture](https://www.asrt.org:/Media/Pdf/ForEducators/4_InstructionalTechniques/4.2Lecture.pdf) of what N. Whitman calls the four levels of competency. The levels advance thus (my paraphrasing in parenthesis):

1.  Unconscious incompetence (you don't know you can't do it)
2.  Conscious incompetence (you know you can't do it)
3.  Conscious competence (you know how to do it)
4.  Unconscious competence (you can do it, but you don't know how).
