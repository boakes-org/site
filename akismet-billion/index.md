# Akismet Billion

It's only 15 months since I mentioned the rocket-like acceleration of [Akismet](http://akismet.com) which went from [a standing start](http://boakes.org/akismet) to the point where it had fended off [a million spam messages](http://boakes.org/akismet-million) for its users in just 4 months. If things had continued at that pace it would have squashed a cool 5 million spams by now. There's been a bit of a ramp, however:

1.  Nine months ago Akismet caught it's 100 millionth spam.
2.  Sometime this week Akismet will kill spam number _one billion_. Check out the stats, watch it happen _[live](http://akismet.com/stats)_. A virtual high-5 to everyone at [Automattic](http://automattic.com). Great job guys, a great service, and the scaling has been perfectly handled. Perhaps we should start a sweep-stake for how long it will take to hit one trillion?
