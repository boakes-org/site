# Towards the Perfect Gadget

Imagine a scene in the not-too distant future... after a frenzied period of leaks, rumours, claims and counter-claims, interspersed with no-comments, denials, and increasingly reliable and suggestive evidence emerging from component and sub-assembly manufacturers, Apple Inc announce the imminent release of _The Perfect Gadget_. The mainstream press attend press conferences and briefings where Apple proclaim that their _Perfect Gadget_ does everything up to, and maybe even including, ordering sliced bread from the online grocer at the precise thickness that it knows you will prefer (a fact derived from a semantic analyses of how you use said gadget). Socially driven news sites will go utterly _berserk_. So how long must we wait until Apple _actually_ makes this announcement? Perhaps we're only five or ten years away from _The Perfect Gadget 1.0_.

## Converging on Perfection, and Overselling the Dream

In 2007, Apple announced their intent to produce the iPhone. Even _before_ the announcement, the iPhone was hotly debated by potential owners whose excitement was akin to a small child who's told they could go on the swings _and_ the roundabouts _and_ visit the local shops to buy as much sugar based confectionery as they can carry _before_ going home to watch cartoons, leading some to call it the [Jesus Phone](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jesus_phone&redirect=no). Even I, as a non Apple owner*, was hooked by the hype. Mesmerised by the hope of a perfect gadget. The iPhone was _never_ going to [change the world](http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=17002), but reading back over some of the rhetoric that Apple spun into their press conferences you'd be forgiven if you thought it would.

When Apple chief Steve Jobs opened his [keynote speech](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/mwsf07/) saying "we're going to make some history together today" it was an archetype of overstatement. Apple are not alone in overselling. The technology industry as a whole is guilty, and the trend is going to increase as gadgets and appliances become less about the technical specifications and more about the design of the hardware and the software. Any company that's marketing something with intangible or immeasurable value, can safely oversell and over-hype their product, because those that buy it want all the hype to be true. They _need_ it to be true to validate their emotional buy-in and to affirm their "lifestyle choice".

## Future Perfect

There will come a time however, when _The Perfect Gadget_ really is released.  It will herald a fundamental change in the the world of consumer electronics.  A ubiquitous device that people don't want to part with.  Users will not upgrade because they will be _perfectly happy_ with it, so eventually there will be billions of units in circulation.

## Past Imperfect

As a seasoned user of seven laptops, seven desktop computers, several hosted severs, eleven different types of mobile phone and three PDAs I've probably invested more time and energy than the average punter who uses gadgets.  I've relied on them for my livelihood, maintained their hardware and software, synchronised their data with the other devices, and failed to part with most of them, so I have a fall-back if the next gadget doesn't work.

So what would be my personal perfect gadget? The gadget that would force me, the moment it's announced, to call up the person on stage announcing it and say "I don't care how much, I want the device that's in your hand, name your price, sir/ma'am, ship it to me _now_".


## The Perfect Gadget Specification

When I wrote them all down, my list of requirements became unwieldy, so I thinned them out to a manageable core.

The perfect gadget should incorporate:

1.  **_Everything_ in the iPhone**. Because in a world where design differentiates, the iPhone is a great design. Telephones have undergone two critical form factor changes in the last 30 years. The first was moving the keypad onto the handset, which enabled the whole phone to become mobile. The second is the removal of the keypad from the handset, which removes the limitation on the device to be _predominantly_ a phone. It can now just be a device that has communication as one of it's capabilities. Apple were not the first people to suggest this: cognitive scientists have been saying it for years, but Apple brought it to market very successfully.
2.  **Screen size vs Portability.** Phone screens are too small and a larger screen area is key to making the gadget useful in more circumstances. Something that uses up every available millimetre in the back pocket of a pair of jeans is perfect.
3.  **Flexibility.** The problem of a device that's sized for the back-pocket is that placing it there will put all kinds of stresses through it (because buttocks are not flat) so some degree of flex would be a bonus.
4.  **[Induction Charging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging).** I never _ever_ want to plug my device in. Instead, I will have a tables and shelves around the house that are rigged up with an inductive charging system. The shelf by the door is a perfect candidate. Anything left on these inductive shelves would be recharged with no need to connect cables. We already have all the phones syncing over Wi-Fi and bluetooth, so it makes total sense to never ever have to plug them in again.
5.  **GPS/Galileo.** I want the unit to know where it is at all times so my whole life can be tracked, then every photo and every calendar event can be correlated. GPS is good, but for Europe, Galileo is likely to be better (because of the control and positioning of the satellites). *[PDA]: Personal Digital Assistant
6. **Tactile Feedback** To provide a more accisible and intuitive interface ([hat tip](http://csamuel.org)).
7. ** Waterproof ** because water happens.



## Benefiting from the Paradox of Choice

Gadgets with a similar form factor to the iPhone are both blessed and cursed with simplicity. The keyless form factor enables the gadget to be more easily be tailored to the users desire, but such devices are intrinsically harder to differentiate, and their potential can overwhelm.  Often the key benefit that gets marketed is that a product can do _more_ than the competition, which leads consumers into the paradox of choice.  With so much potential, how do they avoid selecting the wrong gadget?  They have to fall back on the emotional - they choose the gadget that makes them feel good. This is something Apple do really well, they focus on 'their way' of doing things and make that simple and rewarding.

The perfect gadget, above all, will be intuitive and emotionally rewarding to use. Technological sedimentation and improved software can simplify the multiplicity of capabilities, so a dual focus on the intangible factors of software and hardware design are the critical factors in differentiating gadgets that have identical underlying technological specifications.

Apple's name change from Apple Computer Inc. to Apple Inc. highlights its bias shift towards non-technical consumer devices.  Indeed, Apple are in an enviable position that when they announce something, there is a lot of interest from consumers who tend to not burden themselves with technicalities: they're just happy to know that it's new, that it looks nice, and will reassure their ego of its value, whilst being generally useful and (critically) unchallenging to use.

Enjoy the gadgets, but beware the hyperbole.

* I do in fact own an iPod Shuffle. It was a corporate freebie, so I have no emotional buy-in, but it is far nicer than my _two_ old Diamond Rio PMP300s.
