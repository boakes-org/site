# Bush: “God made me do it”.

So, George W. Bush turns to the Palestinian PM and Foreign Minister and says: "God told me to invade Afghanistan and Iraq". Bearing in mind [this attribution](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/10_october/06/bush.shtml) comes from two people (Prime Minister [Mazen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas) and Foreign Minister [Shaath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng abil_Shaath)) who spoke directly to President Bush, who in turn spoke directly with (his) God, this appears likely to be a _far_ more accurate transcript than any historical religious texts of similar conversations, which were typically written long after the events had occurred, and often recorded only hearsay. What's more, we are lucky enough to have a verbatim quotes from The Lord Himself, who apparently spake unto Mr. President thus:

*   "George, go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan."
*   "George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq"
*   "Go get the Palestinians their state and get the Israelis their security, and get peace in the Middle East."

Remember when the [the buck stopped](http://www.trumanlibrary.org/buckstop.htm) in the [Oval Office](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office)? The words of President Truman in his farewell address seem wonderfully fitting: _"The President; whoever he is; has to decide. He can't pass the buck to anybody. No one else can do the deciding for him. That's his job."_ The White House has, of course, [poured scorn](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4317498.stm) on the allegations.
