# Bird Flu

Bird Flu has reached Britain; smuggled in by a parrot who's been living in quarantine for a few months. The quarantine is such that even the air is filtered, so there's no threat to the public, but that's not stopped the tabloid papers and 24 hour news channels from reporting it at length.  It's a media frenzy.

Looking into the threat I was surprised at how small it really is; it's not negligible, but it's not likly to be the plague that is being hyped.

**If** the A/H5N1 strain of the virus reaches Britain in the wild, and **if** it mutates to a form that can transfer between humans, then the predicted death toll is estimated to be [50,000](http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/influenza/pdfs/HPAPandemicplan.pdf) (see page 8).

This is certainly not to be sniffed at, but, compare that to the 114,000 [deaths that are estimated to occur _every year_ due to smoking](http://www.ash.org.uk/html/factsheets/html/fact02.html) and the size of the threat becomes apparent.

It could have been any bird; but a parrot?

> **Quarantine Officer:** I wish to complain about this parrot what was imported not half a year ago from this very boutique.

> **Importer:** Oh yes, the, uh, the South American Blue... What's, uh... What's wrong with it?  ... etc.
