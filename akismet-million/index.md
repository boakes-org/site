<h1 id="akismet-million">Akismet Million</h1>

A quick hat-tip to Matt Mullenweg whose <a href="http://akismet.com">Akismet</a> service has just caught it's one millionth comment spam message.

I <a href="/akismet">wrote a bit about Akismet</a> a few months ago when it was launched. Prior to that I was one of the testers. I am delighed to say that since it left beta the spam stopping efficiency has not deteriorated from the levels that I experienced during the first tests - and the plugin's interface has improved too.

It's also grown beyond it's wordpress origins with the API being translated to several languages and CMSs. Will 2006 be a completely spam free year? Perhaps.
