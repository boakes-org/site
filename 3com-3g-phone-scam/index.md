# 3Com 3G Phone Scam

I just got called by another TPS-ignoring baby-eating evil telemarketing sales company - it must be my lucky month. Picking up the phone and answering to find musak playing I thought I might be in for the deal of a lifetime, or maybe an offer that was too good to refuse, so I grabbed a pen and paper just in case.  After a few seconds an Indian sounding chap appeared on the line.  His broken pronunciation immediately suggested that English was not his first language.  He told me that he was _"calling from 3com on behalf of 3G"_ and that my land-line number has been specially selected _"to receive a mobile phone absolutely free, including 400 minutes any time any network and 25 free minutes video conferencing, with no roaming charge, no activation charge,"_ ... etc. etc. _"the phone will be a Motorola E1070 camera flip phone..."_.

Naturally there would have to be a line rental, and I'd be getting that at a 50% discount. Paying £17.50 per month instead of £35. I currently have a top-up mobile phone but I use it _so_ infrequently that my last number was reallocated by the phone company because they thought I'd abandoned them: so even if this telemarketer is offering me a great deal, I don't need it, and I'm TPS registered so they're not allowed to waste my time.  So I decide to keep them on the line for as long as possible, and mention that I have another call coming in, so perhaps he wouldn't mind holding for a few seconds. I compose myself, tidy my notes, and return from "my other call"...

## Elaborate Bluff, not.

I asked the guy to elaborate on a few things that were unclear, like:
* Which network the offer was with.  He said _"3G"_.  I didn't want to lead him with any information (like explaining where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G">3G</a> fits into the mobile phone jargon world) so I mention that "of the phone networks in this country, none of them is called '3G'", and he eventually offers _"the network is three but it actually called 3G sir"_.  Um... yeah... this is me, being unimpressed.
* I ask who's calling me, and he repeats "3Com on behalf of 3G". I ask for clarification saying; _"<a href="http://3com.com">3Com as in the company that make network things?</a>"_ and he says _"Yeah, obviously sir, obviously"_.

## Call Termination

So then he passes me off to the "closer" - another Indian sounding chap, for the recorded portion of the phone conversation. I ask the closer where in the world he is and he tells me _"Leeds, South Yorkshire"_.

He asks for my credit card number and date of birth.  I say I'm not comfortable giving out this information because they've called me, and ask if I can have a phone number to call them back on.  He puts the phone down.  If anyone falls for this patter and finds out who's taking money from their account, do tell all - I'd like to know who to register my TPS complaint against, but the caller withheld their number.
