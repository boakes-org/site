# Richard Whiteley: Counted down and out.

BBC News just reported that Richard Whiteley, the presenter of Countdown, has died of a heart attack at the age of 61. Countdown's daytime television time slot gave Whiteley access to an unlikely, diverse and surprisingly loyal audience. When Countdown was first shown (in the days before cable, satellite and freeview) it was broadcast at 4:15 in the afternoon, when the only competition was two channels of children's television. It provided friendly, unpretentious and yet intelligent viewing at just the right time for a <a href="http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com">nice cup of tea and a sit down</a>; something that students and the retired are especially fond of mid-afternoon.

Students in Britain have a history of selecting unlikely heroes, and Whiteley, who was suitably unlikely, made an excellent alternative role model. His combination of sensibly smart clothing, garish ties and enthusiastic delivery of optimistic humour were endearing factors, and although apparently at odds with the sartorial style of his many student fans, his individuality was recognized and appreciated because it came in a jolly and friendly package.

Whiteley pitched the programme in such a way that it was nice to have a challenge, but didn't matter in the slightest if you couldn't finish the puzzles as well as the contestants, because it was a pleasure to have you along for the afternoon. Richard Whiteley featured in a recent series of identity adverts for Channel 4, in which he confirmed his favourite swear word: "Sloblocks", a term which stemmed from a class Fry and Laurie comedy sketch about Countdown. When asked how he'd like to be remembered, he said, "as the first face that appeared on Channel 4".

If you've never Richard on Countdown, there is a segment in the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000063W20/boakesorg-20/202-9025423-1327858">About a Boy</a>.
