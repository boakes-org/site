# Goodbye CRT

My big and very high resolution screen just made a very bad burning smell and went blank. I was ready to hoik it out of the window in case it decided to catch fire, but an acrid smouldering was the best it managed.

This is not the first CRT burnout I've experienced. In '84 I had a very old and second hand 26" television that I used for my computer display, admittedly the resolution was pitiful and fuzzy, but it was the ultimate display at the time for playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_%28computer_game%29">Elite</a>.  That TV must have lasted about 12 months before it went pop and I (aged approximately 12) calmly pulled the plug before nipping downstairs to inform my mother that the telly was on fire. It put itself out in a jiffy, thankfully.

So now I need a new monitor. Fortunately these are the days of multi-monitor machines, so my tall flat panel is now working on it's own and I haven't lost access to my machine, or it's capabilities, so I can go online and order a new screen.  I realise now, that I just unplugged my last CRT monitor.  After twenty-something years of computing, through countless operating systems, and machine architectures, one of the last remaining throwbacks that held me fast to the computing of yesteryear is consigned to the environmentally friendly disposal company.

Goodbye forever Cathode Ray Tube, hello desk space.
