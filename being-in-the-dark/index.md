# Being in the dark

There is a problem with much eclipse development.  When something doesn't work, you're left very much in the dark.  The purposeful lack of documentation thus far - perhaps to enable the platform to remain agile leaves one relying on examples, which is fine - it suits my learning style - but sometimes, when things don't work, it can be a time sapping drag.
