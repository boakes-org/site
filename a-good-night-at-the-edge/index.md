# A Good Night at The Edge

After my <a href="/viva-voce">viva</a> last Tuesday we ended up at the [Edge of The Wedge]( href="http://www.wedgewood-rooms.co.uk/edgeofthewedge.asp) and what was already a very good day got even better thanks to some very talented musicians and a comfy stool at the bar.

When we arrived, a dimly lit bloke was quietly and confidently accompanying himself on guitar. We caught the last two songs and he was really very good. Good enough that we'd happily have stayed in the pub all night if he'd kept playing. He really set up a good atmosphere and his songs were engaging, which can be difficult with just a voice and a guitar, it's easy to get the balances wrong. After the set we'd have bought him a beer, if he'd been old enough... so we got him a a Coke instead. Definitely a talented lad and with his studio debut soon, he's someone we'll be looking out for. His website has a few songs, but the current quality is not a patch on how good he sounds live.  Thanks [Luke Ferre](http://www.myspace.com/lukeferre), pleasure to meet you :)


The second band on stage (it's not a stage, it's the in the corner of the small room) gave us one of those moments that happens rarely in a lifetime - I think we saw a band that's going to be very successful, in a tiny venue, before they get big.

A six piece called [The Velvet Hearts](http://myspace.com/thevelvethearts), and they blew the pub away. It was an electric performance. From the opening harmony of Heart is Breaking through to the end of the set, the performance was exquisitely polished. At times the vocal work was so good that punters were looking around the pub at each other for validation that the this really was happening. The sound was dynamic and seemed to constantly shift in startling and beguiling directions. Like I said, not a common thing. [Their first EP](http://www.indiestore.com/stores/indiedefault.aspx?shop=-38317&amp;g=97bb99da-5cec-46b3-a42b-8ece27f7e7b1) is released next week.

The good news, for anyone Portsmouth based is that Luke Ferre will be back at the edge on 17th July, and before that, The Velvet Hearts will return to Portsmouth on 17th June, playing at the bandstand. If it's a sunny day, it may turn into the most perfect afternoon in history.
